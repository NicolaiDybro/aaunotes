Steps:

Analysis (The world of the user):
- Context
- Condition
- Requirements

Design
- System design
- Without significant uncertainties 

Implementation

Method:
- Guidelines

(OOA&D)
(UML)

Methods can be used in different ways:
- Waterfall
- Interative

## Object vs Class
Object:
- Entity with identity, state and behavior

Class:
- A descrption of a collection of objects sharing structure, patterns and attributes

An object belongs to a class.
Man kan snakke om den klasse et objekt tilhører


## Objects in Analysis and Design

Analysis is outside the computer system and design/implementation is inside the computer system.



## Model of context

### Problem domain
The problem domain is the context that is administrated, monitored or controlled by a system. Meaning that we look at what objects should be used in the context, and which should not be used.

### Application domain
The application domain is the ORGANIZATION that administrates, monitors or controls a problem domain. We describe the users and what they use the system for.  
The user gets the information from the application domain that gets it through that model that gets it through the problem domain. We look at the system.


All this is the: The OOA&D Method


# Factor

- Functionality: The system functions that support the application-do main tasks. 
- Application domain: Those parts of an organization that administrate, monitor, or control a problem domain. 
- Conditions: The conditions under which the system will be developed and used. 
- Technology: Both the technology used to develop the system and the technology on which the system will run. 
- Objects: The main objects in the problem domain. 
- Responsibility: The system’s overall responsibility in relation to its con text.
